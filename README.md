MILESTONE 1 PROJECT OVERVIEW 

**API** :
Stands for APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE.
An API is like a messenger that helps different software systems talk to each other and share information.

**Simple Example**:
A weather app uses an API to get weather data. The app sends a request to a weather service API like this:

Request: "What's the weather in New York?"
Response: "It's sunny, 25°C."

**MERN STACK**:
M - MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing data.
E - Express.js: A backend framework for building APIs.
R - React.js: A frontend library for creating user interfaces.
N - Node.js: A runtime for running JavaScript on the server.

**Simple Example**:
Imagine building a food delivery app:

React creates the user interface (e.g., menus and buttons).
Express and Node.js handle the backend (e.g., orders and user authentication).
MongoDB stores the data (e.g., user profiles, restaurant menus).
MERN is popular for full-stack JavaScript development.

**AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION**:

Authentication = Identity check.
Authorization = Permission check.
They often work together: You authenticate first, then the system checks your authorization to allow or deny access.

**E-COMMERCE APLLICATION**:
An e-commerce application is a digital platform that allows people to buy and sell products or services online. It handles things like product listings, shopping carts, payments, and order tracking. 


**Imagine Amazon or Flipkart**:  
1. You browse products (clothes, gadgets, etc.).  
2. Add items to your shopping cart.  
3. Pay using your preferred method (credit card, wallet, etc.).  
4. The app processes your order and provides delivery updates.  

In short, it’s an online shop accessible through your computer or smartphone.

**FULL STACK**:

A full-stack developer or application refers to someone or something that works on both the front-end and back-end of a web application.

**Front-End**:  
The part users see and interact with (user interface).  
- Examples: Buttons, forms, website layout.  
- Tools: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, etc.

**Back-End**:  
The behind-the-scenes logic and database operations.  
- Examples: Storing user data, handling logins, running server logic.  
- Tools: Node.js, Python, Ruby, databases (e.g., MongoDB, SQL).

**Full-Stack Example**:  
In an e-commerce app, a full-stack developer might:  
1. Build the product page (front-end).  
2. Create the server to handle payments and store orders (back-end).  
3. Manage the database to keep product and user data.

Being full-stack means handling everything needed to build a complete application!
